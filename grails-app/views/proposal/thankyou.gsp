	 		<h2>Thank You!</h2>
			<p>Your proposal has been saved and will show up on the 
				<g:link controller="proposal" action="list">proposed groups list</g:link>.
			</p>
			<p>Now when anyone expresses an interest in your group, you'll receive an email with their contact information.  You may want to consider forming a Google group (or Meetup.com group) and inviting those that express interest.  Forming a Groovy user group is fun and rewarding, but it does take some work.  We'll do what we can to help hook you up with others of like mind, and we'll also help get the word out by posting about your group on Twitter, but you'll still have to do the leg work. </p>
			<p>Below is a link that you can post on other mailing lists and forums, where people who might be interested in your proposal hang out.</p>
			<p><input type="text" style="width:450px;" value="http://g2groups.net/proposed/${proposal.id}" /></p>
			<p>Once you get your new group going, <g:link controller="g2Group" action="p">let us know</g:link>, so we can add it to the Active Groups page.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>Thanks, and have fun!</p>
			<p>The G2Groups team</p>
